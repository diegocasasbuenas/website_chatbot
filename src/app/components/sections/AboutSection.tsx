      title: "What sets Diego apart?",
      content:
        "What makes me unique is my positive attitude toward life and my resilience in the face of failure. Thanks to this combination, I have overcome difficult moments and transformed them into seeds for success. My passion for technology has led me to dive deep into the world of artificial intelligence, while my curiosity about business drives me to combine a technical vision with the ambition of an entrepreneur. In addition, honesty is a core value that I apply both in my work and in my daily life.\n\nI would also define myself as a dreamer, someone who strongly believes in reaching beyond the conventional. I have always felt that the traditional path was not for me and that there was something special within me that I had not fully exploredâ€”until now. This combination of vision, authenticity, and determination is what makes me unique.",
